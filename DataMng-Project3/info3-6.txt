There are many wide-column (column-oriented) databases  in existance, and the top-3
database managers, according to db-engine.com, are developed by Apache. For this reason, 
Hypertable will be included in the following comparative analysis. Also, to shed light 
on the quality of Apache, it should be noted that their two of their column-oriented DBMSes 
included here are within the top-ten of all DBMSes, where as 
hypertable is ranked #156 amoung all DBMSes.

Apache Hbase, and Hypertable are both database management systems (DBMS) which were 
developed with the intent of handling large data. Both DBMSes are open-source and based 
on Google's Bigtable, a proprietary file system. However, only Hbase was writen in the same language
(Java) as Bigtable, while Hypertable uses C++ which is known to be a more functional language, making
it's ranking of the 150's odd. Neither support SQL, nor do they run on schemas, so they are 
'schema free,' which is beneficial in many regards: deep-query ability and a clear path 
to horizontal scalability (ability to increase capacity while they work as a single logical 
unit). Adding contrast between a column-oriented and a relational, neither follow the ACID model that 
Relational Database Model Systems (RDBMS) abide by; Hbase lacks atomicity when performing a transaction 
on multiple rows. Subsequently, although they do not support SQL, they are sometimes preferred
as a DBMS because of their scalability and sometimes-considered easier process because of them not
requiring a schema.
