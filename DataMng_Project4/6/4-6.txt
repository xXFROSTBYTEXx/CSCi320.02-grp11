Key-value stores are possibly the simplest, conceptually, and most
direct form of database model for a Database Management System (DBMS), and 
for the two leading systems, Redis and Memcached, do not display much disparitty.
With this being the case, Redis is 14 rankings ahead of Memcached in the 
overall rankings, but only one in the ranking of the exclisively key-value stores.
Memcached initially releasedseven years prior to Redis' release; however, with this 
and theirr both having a current-generation release, Redis is on a higher version 
number, indicating that Redis updates their product more often Subsequently, this explains 
their higher ranking among databases alike and overall. Another benefactor lrading 
to Redis' success is probably due to their suppor of 'typing,' which is predefned
data types, such as date and float. Lastly, Redis makes their application programatically
available to 36 different languages, which ultimately broadens their clientel and 
mass-appeal.
