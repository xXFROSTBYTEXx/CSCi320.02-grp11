An insert anomaly occurs when an entry cannot be inserted becausea an attribute is not present (NULL).

Courses
NAME		ID		STUDENT		GPA		ENROLLED

CS-320		142		Jip Kolon	3.0		10-01-2016
CS-320		142		Kirk Kolon	1.68	09-22-2016
CS-561		687		Mip Pelick	3.78	11-27-2016

The insertion anomaly happens since an entry cannot be inseerted, if that entry's student name is NULL. A primary key cannot be null.


The deletion anomaly occurs when one entry is present in a table, and is to be deleted. Doing so will delete the table's information

If the table were:

Courses
NAME		ID		STUDENT		GPA		ENROLLED

CS-320		142		Jip Kolon	3.0		10-01-2016

If this student were to drop the course than all of the table's information is gone.


Occuring in inconsistent database, update anomalies happen when modifying an entry, causes another entry to be updated.

Courses
NAME		ID		STUDENT		GPA		ENROLLED

CS-320		142		Jip Kolon	3.0		10-01-2016
PK-510		435		Jip Kolon	3.0		10-01-2016
CS-561		687		Mip Pelick	3.78	11-27-2016


In this table, only modifying, say GPA, will create an inconsistency, such that the second instance of Kirk will have the old GPA.
